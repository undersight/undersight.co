Borgo is a Swedish fintech, originally founded as a mortgage aggregator. After being handed a license to provide a wider range of financial services by Swedish legislators, it became clear to them they would need to adapt their existing brand to fit their new strategyâ€”with a matching website and app. I was very happy to help lead that project.

Their original brand had been designed by another agency, not long before we were brought in. It revolved heavily around the logotype and a set of single-stroke illustrations by [Jonathan Calugi](https://www.behance.net/Lovers). It was quite good, but had been designed for a company with a much smaller range of services than Borgo was about to become.

> So we sat down with the client, walked them through some of the brand's limitations, and explained what we could do to overcome them.

It started with keeping the existing core elements (logo and illustrations) and expanding outwards from there. We tweaked the color palette to fit their tone of voice, added a serifed typeface to expand their typographical range, and developed ways to combine everything into coherent yet flexible compositions. We brought Jonathan back in and asked him to make his illustrations move.
